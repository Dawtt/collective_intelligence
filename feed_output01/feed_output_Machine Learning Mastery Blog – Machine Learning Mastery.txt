<p>Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of accelerometer data recorded by specialized harnesses or smart phones into known well-defined movements. It is a challenging problem given the large number of observations produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate accelerometer data to [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Indoor movement prediction involves using wireless sensor strength data to predict the location and motion of subjects within a building. It is a challenging problem as there is no direct analytical model to translate the variable length traces of signal strength data from multiple sensors into user behavior. The &#8216;indoor user movement&#8216; dataset is a [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Air pollution is characterized by the concentration of ground ozone. From meteorological measurements, such as wind speed and temperature, it is possible to forecast whether the ground ozone will be at a sufficiently high level tomorrow to issue a public air pollution warning.

<p>How to Score Probability Predictions in Python and Develop an Intuition for Different Metrics. Predicting probabilities instead of class labels for a classification problem can provide additional nuance and uncertainty for the predictions. The added nuance allows more sophisticated metrics to be used to interpret and evaluate the predicted probabilities. In general, methods for the [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Instead of predicting class values directly for a classification problem, it can be convenient to predict the probability of an observation belonging to each possible class. Predicting probabilities allows some flexibility including deciding how to interpret the probabilities, presenting predictions with uncertainty, and providing more nuanced ways to evaluate the skill of the model.

**************summary*************
<p>It can be more flexible to predict probabilities of an observation belonging to each class in a classification problem rather than predicting classes directly. This flexibility comes from the way that probabilities may be interpreted using different thresholds that allow the operator of the model to trade-off concerns in the errors made by the model, [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Small computers, such as Arduino devices, can be used within buildings to record environmental variables from which simple and useful properties can be predicted. One example is predicting whether a room or rooms are occupied based on environmental measures such as temperature, humidity, and related measures. This is a type of common time series classification [&#8230;]</p>
