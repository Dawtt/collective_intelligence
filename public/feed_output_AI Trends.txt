They can be a doozy. Let me share with you an example that happened to me some years ago. I was stopped at a red light and idly looking around, awaiting a green light. My driver’s side window was rolled down and it was a nice [&#8230;]

It’s a dog eat dog world and if you can gain an advantage over your competition, so the better you shall be. If you can even somehow drive your competition out [&#8230;]

I am interested in new job descriptions around data science, big data, machine learning, digital knowledge, AI interaction, natural language processing and others not mentioned here but that you might be involved in. I would [&#8230;]

It was not that the Spanish-born scientist, a self-described “machine learning (ML) person,” hadn’t already witnessed how AI could help Facebook. Since joining the company in [&#8230;]

AI has also been touted as the new must-have [&#8230;]

An agreement between Alibaba and the IT consulting unit of Britain’s former phone monopoly could be similar to Alibaba’s existing arrangement with Vodafone Group Plc in Germany, according [&#8230;]

Every time you watch a film Netflix has suggested or buy a “similar product” on Amazon, it is a personalized recommendation. Can you make such recommendations work for your business as [&#8230;]

No, not the danger of an army of AI-powered robots taking over the world (though that is a bit concerning). The real fear is that the wrong vendor is chosen or the rollout handled poorly. After all, AI is complex, not fully mature, in some cases poorly understood, and [&#8230;]

But that number pales in comparison to the number of connected devices worldwide. According to Autonomous, a financial research firm, people are outnumbered three-to-one by their smart computing devices — an estimated 22 billion in total. And the number of smart devices will [&#8230;]

Considering the cost of implementing AI and the organizational challenges that come with it, it’s no surprise that smart companies seek ways to test the solutions before implementing them and get [&#8230;]
